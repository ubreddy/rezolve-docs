# Ingest Documents in Knowledge Base

This guide will walk you through the process of uploading and ingesting documents into your knowledge base, making them searchable and accessible to users and virtual agents.

## Document Ingestion Overview

### Supported Document Types
- List of file formats supported for ingestion
- Size limitations and optimization recommendations
- Recommended formats for different content types
- Document preparation best practices
- Screenshot of supported document types

### Ingestion Methods
- Web interface upload process
- Bulk upload capabilities
- API-based ingestion
- Email-to-knowledge conversion
- Integration with cloud storage
- Screenshot of upload interface

## Step-by-Step Ingestion Process

### Preparing Documents
- Document naming conventions
- Metadata preparation
- Content structuring guidelines
- File optimization techniques
- Pre-ingestion checklist

### Uploading Documents
- Single file upload walkthrough
- Folder and multi-file upload process
