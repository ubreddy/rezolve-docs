# Past Conversations

### Simple Queries:

- Type your question naturally, as you would ask a human
- Example: "How do I reset my password?" or "What are the office hours?"

### Follow-up Questions:

- The Virtual Agent maintains context, so you can ask follow-up questions without repeating information
- Example: After asking about password reset, you might ask "How long does it take?"

### Clarifications:

- If your question is ambiguous, the agent will ask for clarification
- You can provide additional details to help the agent understand your needs

## Creating Tickets

### Initiating Ticket Creation:

- Express your need: "I need help with my laptop" or "I'd like to request access to the finance system"
- Or use explicit commands: "Create a ticket" or "Submit a request"

### Providing Information:

- The agent will guide you through providing necessary details
- Answer questions about the issue, priority, category, and other relevant information
- Upload attachments if needed (supported in all channels)

### Reviewing and Submitting:

- The agent will present a summary of your ticket for review
- Confirm the details or make corrections as needed
- Upon confirmation, the ticket will be created and you'll receive a confirmation with the ticket number

## Checking Ticket Status

### Requesting Status Updates:

- Ask about your tickets: "What's the status of my tickets?" or "Show me my open requests"
- Inquire about a specific ticket: "What's happening with ticket IT-1234?"

### Viewing Details:

- The agent will display ticket information, including status, assigned agent, and recent updates
- You can request more information: "Show me the comments" or "When was it last updated?"

### Taking Actions:

- Add notes: "Add a comment to this ticket"
- Update information: "Change the priority to high"
- Close resolved tickets: "I'm satisfied with the resolution, please close this ticket"

## Live Chat Support

### Requesting Live Assistance:

- If the automated responses don't resolve your issue, request human assistance
- Examples: "I need to speak with a human" or "Connect me to an agent"

### Queue Management:

- The Virtual Agent will check agent availability and queue status
- You'll be informed about estimated wait times
- You can continue the conversation with the bot while waiting

### Agent Handoff:

- When an agent becomes available, you'll be notified
- The agent will receive the conversation history for context
