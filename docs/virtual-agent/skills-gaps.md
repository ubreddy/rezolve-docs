# Bot Skills and Gaps

### Understanding Capabilities

1. **Discovering What's Possible**:
   - Ask directly: "What can you do?" or "Help me understand your capabilities"
   - The agent will provide an overview of its functions and suggest common actions

2. **Template Discovery**:
   - Explore available service templates: "What kinds of tickets can I submit?"
   - View categorized options for different request types

3. **Knowledge Base Access**:
   - Access documentation: "Show me articles about VPN access"
   - The agent can retrieve and display relevant knowledge base articles

### Handling Limitations

1. **Recognizing Gaps**:
   - The Virtual Agent will acknowledge when it cannot answer a question or perform a requested action
   - It will suggest alternatives or offer to connect you with human support

2. **Providing Feedback**:
   - Rate responses to help improve the system
   - Offer specific feedback about why a response was not helpful
   - Submit suggestions for new capabilities or knowledge articles

3. **Escalation Paths**:
   - Understand how to escalate issues beyond the bot's capabilities
   - Learn about alternative support channels for complex scenarios

The Virtual Agent continuously learns from interactions to improve its capabilities and reduce knowledge gaps over time.
