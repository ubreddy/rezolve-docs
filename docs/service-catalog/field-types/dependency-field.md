Dependency fields establish dynamic relationships between fields, allowing the system to adapt form behavior based on user inputs.

### Key Properties
- **Parent Field**: Specification of the controlling field
- **Dependency Rules**: Conditions that determine field behavior
- **Behavior Options**: Configuration of visibility, editability, or required status
- **Multiple Dependencies**: Support for complex conditions involving multiple fields
- **Value Mapping**: Optional automatic value population based on parent field

### Use Cases
- Showing relevant subcategories based on main category selection
- Making fields required based on specific conditions
- Populating default values based on other selections
- Creating branching workflows within forms
- Implementing conditional validation rules
