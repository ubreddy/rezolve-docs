Intents in the Service Catalog provide a way to categorize and organize ticket templates based on the nature or purpose of the request. Intents serve as containers for related templates and can be associated with specific audiences for targeted visibility.

## Standard Intent Types
- **Request**: For service requests and general inquiries
- **Problem**: For issue reporting and troubleshooting
- **Change**: For change management processes
- **Incident**: For reporting service disruptions or unexpected behaviors

## Key Features

### Intent Creation and Management
- Create standard or custom intents to organize templates
- Assign templates to specific intents for better categorization
- Configure audience restrictions for each intent

### Audience Association
- Associate intents with specific audiences to control visibility
- Ensure templates within an intent are only visible to the appropriate users
- Create targeted service experiences based on user roles, attributes, or groups

### Intent-Based Navigation
- Enables users to browse available services by intent category
- Simplifies the service catalog interface by grouping related templates
- Provides context for users about the nature of each template

## Implementation
1. Access the Intents section in the Service Catalog
2. Create new intents or modify existing ones
