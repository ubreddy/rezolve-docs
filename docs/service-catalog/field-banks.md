## Field Banks

The Field Bank in Rezolve.ai's Service Catalog provides a centralized repository for creating and managing reusable fields that can be incorporated into multiple templates across the tenant. This feature promotes consistency, reduces duplication of effort, and simplifies template management by allowing administrators to define commonly used fields once and reuse them wherever needed.


### Accessing the Field Bank

To access the Field Bank:
Navigate to the Service Catalog
Select "Fields" from the main navigation menu
You'll see a list of all available fields in your tenant


### Understanding the Field Bank

The Field Bank serves as a library of pre-defined fields that can be added to any template in your tenant. When you create a new tenant, the system automatically provides approximately 53 commonly used fields to help you get started quickly.

### Field Types Available

The Field Bank supports all the same field types available in regular template creation:

Text (single-line and multi-line)
Number
Dropdown (single and multi-select)
Date/Time
Boolean (yes/no)
Rich text
Email
URL
Phone
Media/Attachment
User/People picker
Reference fields


### Creating a New Field

To add a new field to the Field Bank:

1: In the Field Bank screen, click "Create Field" or "Add New"
2: Select the field type from the dropdown
3: Enter a name for the field
4: Configure field properties:
   		Default value
		Placeholder text
		Help text
		Validation rules
		Options (for dropdown fields)
5: Save your field
