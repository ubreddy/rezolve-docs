# Service Catalog Overview

The Service Catalog is a key component of the Rezolve.ai platform that allows organizations to create, manage, and deploy customizable templates for various business processes. It serves as a central repository for standardized service requests, incident reports, and other operational workflows.

The Service Catalog enables administrators to:

- Create and manage ticket templates with customizable fields
- Define workflows for different business processes
- Configure conditions and rules for field visibility and editability
- Apply role-based permissions
- Set up automated actions based on events
- Implement multi-language support through locales

These templates, once approved, become available to end-users through various channels including the Agent UI, web interface, Microsoft Teams, and through the Rezolve.ai Virtual Agent.
