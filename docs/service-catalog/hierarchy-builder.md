The Hierarchy Builder is a critical component of the Service Catalog that allows administrators to create multi-level hierarchies to organize tickets and streamline routing processes.

## Key Features

### Creating Hierarchies
- Create custom hierarchies based on organizational structure or business requirements
- Define multiple levels within each hierarchy to represent the depth of classification needed
- Assign values to each level of the hierarchy to represent specific categories, departments, or service areas

### Hierarchy Mapping
- Map hierarchies to templates using the Map Hierarchy feature in the template's advanced settings
- Select which levels of the hierarchy to display during ticket creation
- Configure whether to show all values in a level regardless of parent field selection

### Benefits
- Enables complex ticket routing based on hierarchical selections
- Provides structured categorization for reporting and analytics
- Simplifies the end-user experience by presenting relevant options based on previous selections

### Usage
Hierarchies are particularly valuable for organizations with:
- Multiple departments requiring different service paths
- Complex service structures with parent-child relationships
- Need for granular routing rules based on categorization

### Implementation
1. Access the Hierarchy Builder from the Service Catalog menu
2. Create a new hierarchy by defining a name and description
3. Add levels to the hierarchy (e.g., Department → Team → Service)
4. Populate each level with appropriate values
5. Map the hierarchy to relevant templates through the Map Hierarchy tab in the template's advanced settings

### Best Practices
- Keep hierarchy structures intuitive and aligned with organizational structure
- Limit hierarchy depth to 3-5 levels to maintain usability
- Regularly review and update hierarchies as organizational needs change
- Use consistent naming conventions across hierarchy levels
