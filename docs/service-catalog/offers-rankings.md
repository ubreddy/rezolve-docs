Offers represent the specific instances of templates that are published to end-users. The Offers & Rankings feature allows administrators to control the visibility, order, and presentation of these offers in the Agent UI.

## Key Features

### Offer Management
- View all available offers across templates in a single interface
- Control which offers are visible in the Agent UI
- Rearrange the order of offers to prioritize frequently used options

### Multi-Offer Templates
- Create multiple offers from a single template
- Configure different field sets for different offers based on the same template
- Tailor offers for different use cases or audiences while maintaining consistent workflows

### Example Use Case
An "Employee Onboarding" template can generate multiple offers such as:
- HR Onboarding
- IT Employee Onboarding
- Banking Employee Onboarding

Each offer uses the same underlying template but may have different field configurations across layouts (Inbox/Create/Detail).

### Offer Configuration
1. Create and configure a base template with all potential fields
2. Create multiple offers based on the template
3. Configure each offer with appropriate field visibility and requirements
4. Set audience restrictions if needed
5. Arrange offers in the desired display order

### Ranking System
- Drag-and-drop interface for rearranging offers
- Higher-ranked offers appear more prominently in the Agent UI
- Group related offers together for improved user experience

## Implementation

## Best Practices
- Name offers clearly to indicate their specific purpose
- Keep the most frequently used offers at the top of the list
- Group related offers together for better organization
- Regularly review usage statistics to optimize offer rankings
- Use consistent naming conventions for related offers
