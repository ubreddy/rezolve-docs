State categories group similar states together based on their function in the ticket lifecycle. The Service Catalog includes three default categories that are color-coded for easy identification.

### Default Categories

#### To-Do Category (Black)
- Represents initial or pending states where action is required
- Typically includes states like "New," "Open," or "Waiting for Input"
- Indicates tickets that need attention or are in a queue

#### In-Progress Category (Blue)
- Represents active states where work is currently being performed
- Includes states like "Under Investigation," "In Review," or "Being Processed"
- Indicates tickets that are actively being worked on by agents

#### Done Category (Green)
- Represents final states where the ticket lifecycle is complete
- Includes states like "Resolved," "Closed," or "Completed"
- Indicates tickets that require no further action

### Custom Categories
While the three default categories cannot be deleted, you can add custom categories to match your organization's specific workflow needs:
1. In the Workflow Editor, click "Add Category."
2. Provide a name for the new category.
3. Select a color for visual identification.
4. Save the new category.

Categories help organize and visualize the workflow, making it easier to understand at a glance which tickets need attention and which are completed.
