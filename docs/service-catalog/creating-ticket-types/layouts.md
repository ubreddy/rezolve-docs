Layouts determine how fields are organized and presented to users. They allow you to create structured, intuitive interfaces for ticket creation and management.

### Layout Structure
Layouts are built using a section-based approach:
- **Sections**: Container elements that group related fields
- **Nested Sections**: Sections can be placed inside other sections to create a hierarchy
- **Field Placement**: Fields can be added to sections according to logical groupings

### Layout Conditions
Similar to field-level conditions, you can set layout-level conditions to control visibility and editability:
- **Visibility Conditions**: Show or hide entire sections based on specific criteria
- **Editability Conditions**: Make sections editable or read-only based on specific criteria

### Layout Design Considerations
- **Group related fields**: Organize fields that belong together in the same section
- **Progressive disclosure**: Use conditions to show fields only when they become relevant
- **Responsive design**: Consider how layouts will appear on different devices
