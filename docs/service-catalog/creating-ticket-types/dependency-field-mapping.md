Field mapping allows for the connection of fields between different systems or within the same system for data consistency and automation.

### Meta Field Mapping
Meta fields connect template-specific fields to standardized fields used across the system:
- Create meta fields in the Meta Field submenu
- Map corresponding ticket type fields to the meta field
- Use meta fields in list views, dashboards, and reports

### Benefits of Meta Field Mapping
- **Consistent Reporting**: Compare data across different templates
- **Simplified Views**: Create standardized list views
- **Dashboard Integration**: Create insightful visualizations
- **Data Consistency**: Maintain standardized data structures

## External System Mapping
When integrating with external systems (like email servers), field mapping ensures data flows correctly:

### Email Server Mapping
- Map email properties to ticket fields (e.g., subject to summary)
- Connect email attachments to ticket attachment fields
- Ensure proper threading of email replies to ticket notes

### Mapping Applications

### For Dashboards
Meta field mapping enhances dashboard capabilities:
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Compare ticket volumes by category, location, or agent
- **Grouped Bar Charts**: Track trends across multiple variables
- **Line & Series Charts**: Analyze response rates and ticket trends over time

### For Data Integration
- **API Integration**: Map fields for incoming and outgoing API data
- **Import/Export**: Facilitate data migration between systems
- **Synchronization**: Keep related systems updated with consistent information
