This section provides a detailed exploration of field configuration and advanced usage beyond the basic field types covered earlier.

### Special Fields
Special fields provide enhanced functionality beyond standard data capture:

### Notes
Dedicated sections for different types of communication:
- **Public Notes**: Visible to all ticket participants
- **Private Notes**: Visible only to internal staff
- **Chase Notes**: Used for following up on outstanding issues
- **Resolution Notes**: Document how issues were resolved

### History
Automatically tracks all changes to the ticket, including:
- Field value changes
- Status transitions
- Actor assignments
- Note additions

### Linked Tickets
Displays relationships with other tickets:
- Shows parent/child relationships
- Lists related tickets
- Provides quick access to associated tickets

### Smart Summary
Provides an AI-generated summary of the ticket activity:
- Comprehensiveness options (Detailed, Balanced, Crisp)
- Style options (Professional, Casual, Empathetic)
- Customizable field inclusion

### Field Dependencies
Create relationships between fields to build dynamic forms:

### Cascading Dropdowns
- Parent field selection determines options in child fields
- Updates automatically when parent value changes
- Can have multiple levels of dependencies

### Calculated Fields
- Values automatically generated based on other field values
- Can use formulas, concatenation, or logic
- Update in real-time as dependent fields change

### Dynamic Requirements
- Fields become required or optional based on other field values
- Visibility toggles based on selections
- Editability changes according to conditional logic

### Field Integration
Fields can integrate with external systems and processes:

### API-Connected Fields
- Pull data from external APIs
- Validate input against external databases
- Send updates to integrated systems

### Automation Triggers
- Field changes can trigger workflows or actions
- Value thresholds can initiate escalations
- Pattern recognition can route tickets automatically

### Reporting Integration
Fields can be designated for inclusion in standard reports:
- Custom field values can drive dashboard visualizations
- Field trends can generate automated insights

By leveraging these advanced field capabilities, you can create sophisticated ticket templates that capture exactly the information needed while providing a streamlined user experience through dynamic forms and intelligent data handling.
