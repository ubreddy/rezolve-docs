Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and metrics are crucial for tracking ticket performance and ensuring timely resolution. They help organizations maintain service standards and identify areas for improvement.

### SLA Configuration
SLAs define the time frames within which tickets should be addressed or resolved:

### SLA Components
- **Name**: A descriptive title for the SLA (e.g., "Critical Issue Response")
- **Description**: Explanation of what the SLA covers
- **Application Criteria**: Conditions that determine when the SLA applies
- **Time Targets**: The timeframes that must be met
- **Business Hours**: Whether the SLA runs on business hours or calendar hours
- **Escalation Rules**: Actions to take when SLA thresholds are approaching or breached

### SLA Metrics
Common metrics that can be tracked include:
- **First Response Time**: Time between ticket creation and first agent response
- **Resolution Time**: Total time from creation to resolution
- **Agent Work Time**: Actual time spent working on the ticket
- **Time in Status**: How long tickets remain in specific statuses

### Metric Tracking
The system allows for comprehensive metric tracking across various dimensions:

### Default Metrics
- **Volume**: Total number of tickets
- **Average Resolution Time**: Average time to resolve tickets
- **SLA Compliance**: Percentage of tickets meeting SLA requirements
- **Agent Performance**: Metrics per agent

### Custom Metrics
Create custom metrics based on specific business needs:
- Define the metric name and calculation method
- Select the fields or events to track
- Set up visualization preferences for reporting

### Performance Dashboards
Metrics can be visualized in customizable dashboards:
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live view of current ticket status and metrics
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend analysis over time periods
- **Comparative Views**: Performance across teams, agents, or ticket types
- **Drill-down Capabilities**: Ability to examine specific tickets contributing to metrics
