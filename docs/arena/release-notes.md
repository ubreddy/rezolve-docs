# Release Notes

## January 2026

### 17 Jan 2026

#### DRI-7256: Knowledge Integrations UI

Introduced a new user-facing interface for configuring knowledge integrations, enabling administrators to easily connect, configure, and manage external knowledge sources like SharePoint, Confluence, and others with:

- **Setup wizard** – Connect, select content, and configure sync schedule
- **Sync controls** – Trigger manual sync, stop in-progress syncs, download logs (Download logs feature will be deployed on Monday)
- **Audience targeting** – Assign access per content set (with SharePoint permission inheritance)
