A: Rezolve.ai's Live Chat system allows each agent to handle up to five concurrent conversations. This limit balances efficiency with quality, ensuring agents can maintain effective communication with multiple users.

**Q: Can we customize the chat widget appearance?**

**Q: Does the system support multiple languages?**  
A: Yes, Rezolve.ai's Live Chat supports multiple languages for both the user interface and canned responses. The system can detect user language preferences and route conversations to appropriately skilled agents.

**Q: How does chat prioritization work?**  
A: Chats are prioritized based on configurable rules that can consider factors such as user type, issue category, waiting time, and custom attributes. These rules ensure that high-priority conversations receive appropriate attention.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What browsers are supported for the agent interface?**  
A: The agent interface works with all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. For optimal performance, we recommend keeping browsers updated to the latest version.

**Q: Can agents use the interface on mobile devices?**  
A: Yes, the agent interface is responsive and works on tablets and larger mobile devices. However, for extended use and maximum efficiency, we recommend desktop or laptop computers.

**Q: How is chat data secured?**  
A: All chat communications are encrypted using industry-standard protocols. The system complies with relevant data protection regulations and supports custom data retention policies to meet specific compliance requirements.

**Q: Can we integrate Live Chat with our existing systems?**  
A: Yes, Rezolve.ai offers APIs and pre-built integrations with popular CRM, ITSM, and customer service platforms. These integrations allow for seamless data exchange and unified workflow management.

### Agent Management

**Q: How do we set agent schedules and availability?**  
A: Agents can set their own availability status, or supervisors can manage agent schedules through the administration interface. The system also supports integration with workforce management tools for more complex scheduling needs.

**Q: How are agents assigned to queues?**  
A: Administrators can assign agents to specific queues based on skills, departments, or other organizational structures. Agents can be assigned to multiple queues with different priorities to optimize workload distribution.

**Q: What happens when no agents are available?**  
A: When no agents are available, the system can be configured to show estimated wait times, offer callback options, create tickets automatically, or direct users to self-service alternatives. These fallback options are fully customizable.

**Q: How do we track agent performance?**  
A: Comprehensive agent performance metrics are available through the analytics dashboard and reports. These metrics include average handling time, customer satisfaction ratings, number of chats handled, and custom KPIs that align with your specific service goals.

### User Experience

**Q: Can users request chat transcripts?**  
A: Yes, users can request chat transcripts, which can be sent automatically at the end of conversations or provided on demand. Transcript delivery can be configured to align with your organization's policies.

**Q: How does the system handle connection issues?**  
A: The system includes robust reconnection capabilities that attempt to restore interrupted sessions. If reconnection isn't possible, the system preserves the conversation history and can notify agents of the disconnection.

**Q: Can users upload files during chats?**  
A: Yes, users can upload files (documents, images, etc.) during chat conversations. File types and sizes can be restricted based on your organization's security policies.

**Q: How does the chat system integrate with the Virtual Agent?**  
A: The chat system seamlessly integrates with Rezolve.ai's Virtual Agent, allowing for smooth transitions between automated and human support. When the Virtual Agent cannot resolve an issue, it can transfer the conversation to a live agent along with complete context.

### Administration and Configuration

**Q: How do we set up chat routing rules?**  
A: Chat routing rules are configured in the Queue Management section. These rules can be based on user attributes, query content, or custom logic to ensure conversations reach the most appropriate teams.

**Q: Can we schedule different operating hours for different queues?**  
A: Yes, each queue can have its own operating hours schedule, including business hours, after-hours handling, holidays, and special events. The system automatically routes and manages conversations based on these schedules.

**Q: How do we create and manage canned responses?**  
A: Canned responses are created and managed in the Canned Responses section. Each response includes the full text, a short key for quick access, language specification, and status (active/inactive). Responses can be organized by categories and shared across teams or restricted to specific queues.

**Q: Can we customize post-chat surveys?**  
A: Yes, post-chat surveys are fully customizable. You can define questions, response types, timing, and delivery methods to align with your specific feedback collection goals and user experience preferences.
