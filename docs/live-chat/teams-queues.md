The Rezolve.ai Live Chat system organizes support through a structured teams and queues framework that directs conversations to the appropriate agents based on expertise and availability. As an agent, understanding this structure is essential for effective participation in the chat support ecosystem.

### Queue Structure

Queues in Rezolve.ai function as specialized channels for different types of inquiries or departments. Each queue is configured with specific routing rules that determine which conversations are directed to it based on various criteria such as:

- Topic or issue category
- User attributes (e.g., department, location, role)
- Priority levels
- Custom business rules

Agents are assigned to specific queues based on their knowledge, skills, and responsibilities. This ensures that conversations reach agents who are best equipped to handle particular types of inquiries.

### Queue Assignment

As an agent, you'll be assigned to one or more queues by your supervisor or chat administrator. Your queue assignments determine which conversations will be routed to you when you're available. The assignment process involves:

- Administrator adding you to appropriate queues based on your expertise
- Setting any specialization parameters within those queues
- Establishing your capacity (maximum concurrent chats)
- Configuring any priority rules that apply to your assignments

### Team Structure

Teams in Rezolve.ai represent broader organizational groups that typically align with support functions or departments. Each team may manage multiple queues, and agents are typically members of at least one team.

The team structure provides:

- Organizational clarity
- Management hierarchy
- Reporting frameworks
- Resource allocation boundaries

Understanding your team membership helps you identify your colleagues who handle similar issues and your supervisors who provide guidance and support.
