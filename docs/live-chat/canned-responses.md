Canned Responses are pre-written messages that help you respond quickly and consistently to common questions or situations. They save time while ensuring accuracy and completeness in your communications.

### Accessing Canned Responses

You can access canned responses in several ways:

- **Response Library**: Click the canned response icon to browse available responses by category
- **Search**: Use the search function to find responses by keyword

### Using Responses Effectively

While canned responses save time, they should be used thoughtfully:

- **Appropriateness**: Ensure the response truly fits the situation
- **Natural Flow**: Integrate canned text naturally into the conversation

- **Customization**: Make minor edits to better address the specific question

**Best Practice**: Review a canned response before sending to ensure it completely and accurately addresses the user's question.
