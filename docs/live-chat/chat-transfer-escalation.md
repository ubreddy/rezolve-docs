Rezolve.ai's Live Chat platform includes sophisticated transfer and escalation capabilities that ensure conversations reach the right expertise level quickly while maintaining a seamless user experience. These features enable support teams to collaborate effectively and resolve complex issues efficiently.

### Transferring Conversations

Agents can transfer conversations to colleagues or specialized queues with a few simple clicks. The transfer interface allows agents to:

- Select the destination (specific agent or queue)
- Include transfer notes that provide context for the receiving agent
- Preserve all conversation history and attached files during transfer

### Intelligent Routing

Intelligent routing during transfers considers:

- Agent availability
- Workload
- Specialized skills

When transferring to queues rather than specific agents, the system applies the same routing rules used for initial assignments, ensuring consistent handling of specialized topics.

### Escalation to Supervisors

For situations requiring supervisor intervention, agents can escalate conversations without fully transferring them. This escalation mode allows:

- Supervisors to join the conversation temporarily
- Providing guidance while allowing the original agent to maintain ownership of the interaction
- Supporting agent development while ensuring users receive expert assistance for complex issues

### Transfer Types

The system supports both warm and cold transfers:

- **Warm Transfers**: The original agent remains in the conversation until the receiving agent joins, allowing for a personal handoff and introduction
- **Cold Transfers**: Move the conversation immediately, which may be appropriate for specialized queues with standard greeting protocols

### Conference Chats

For scenarios requiring involvement from multiple departments, the platform supports conference chats where representatives from different teams can collaborate within a single conversation. This capability is particularly valuable for complex issues that cross departmental boundaries.

### Analytics and Monitoring

All transfers and escalations are tracked and included in analytics, allowing organizations to:

- Identify patterns that might indicate training needs or process improvements
- Monitor transfer chains to prevent conversations from being passed between too many agents

These comprehensive transfer and escalation mechanisms ensure that conversations reach the appropriate expertise level efficiently while maintaining context and creating a seamless experience for users.
