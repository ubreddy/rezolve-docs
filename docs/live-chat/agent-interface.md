The Agent Interface is your primary workspace for managing live chat interactions with users. This intuitive interface is designed to help you efficiently handle multiple conversations while maintaining context and quality.

### Dashboard Overview

When you log in to the Live Chat system, your dashboard provides an immediate overview of:

- Your current availability status
- Queues you're assigned to
- Waiting conversations in your queues
- Your active conversations
- Team performance metrics
- Personal statistics

### Availability Controls

The availability toggle is your primary control for indicating when you're ready to receive chat assignments:

- **Available**: You're ready to accept new conversations
- **Unavailable**: You'll stop receiving new conversations

When setting yourself to unavailable, you'll be prompted to select a reason from the predefined list (e.g., Lunch Break, Meeting, Training). This helps supervisors understand agent capacity patterns and plan accordingly.

### Chat Window Layout

Each active conversation appears in its own panel within the interface, containing:

- User identification and relevant attributes
- Conversation history
- Message composition area
- Typing indicator (when user is typing)
- Time indicators showing response times
- Quick access to canned responses
- Options for file sharing, transfers, and closing

The multi-panel design allows you to efficiently manage up to 5 concurrent conversations while maintaining context for each interaction.

### User Context Panel

For each conversation, a context panel provides valuable background information:

- User name and basic information
- Relevant attributes (department, location, etc.)
- Previous conversation history
- Related tickets or service requests
- User's recent bot interactions
- Any custom fields configured for your organization

This contextual information helps you provide personalized service without asking the user to repeat information they've already provided elsewhere in the system.
