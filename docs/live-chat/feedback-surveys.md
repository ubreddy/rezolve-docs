Rezolve.ai's Live Chat system includes robust feedback collection mechanisms that help organizations measure performance and continuously improve support quality. These tools capture user sentiment during and after chat interactions, providing valuable insights for both individual agent coaching and system-wide enhancements.

### Post-Chat Surveys

Post-chat surveys automatically trigger when conversations conclude, asking users to rate their experience and provide additional comments. These surveys are fully customizable, allowing organizations to ask specific questions aligned with their service goals. The default survey includes:

- **Satisfaction Rating**: Typically on a 1-5 scale
- **Optional Comments Field**: For qualitative feedback

### Survey Delivery Options

Survey delivery can be configured in several ways:

- **In-Chat Interface**: Appears immediately after conversation conclusion
- **Email**: Sent for later completion
- **Conditional Surveys**: Adapt based on conversation characteristics (e.g., different questions for short vs. long interactions or specific query types)

### Optimizing Response Rates

Response rates are optimized through:

- **User-Friendly Design**: Brief, mobile-responsive, and accessible surveys
- **Survey Fatigue Prevention**: Controls frequency and targeting based on user history

### Feedback Analytics

Collected feedback is immediately available in the analytics dashboard, where it's correlated with other metrics such as:

- Resolution time
- Queue
- Agent
- Topic

This integration enables organizations to identify patternsâ€”for example, discovering that certain issue types consistently receive lower satisfaction scores, which might indicate a need for process improvements or additional agent training.

### Agent Performance and Coaching

For agents, feedback is incorporated into:

- **Performance Metrics**: Track individual agent performance
- **Coaching Opportunities**: Identify areas for improvement or recognition
- **Supervisor Alerts**: Automatically alert managers to negative ratings that might require follow-up

### Continuous Improvement

Through these comprehensive feedback mechanisms, organizations can create a continuous improvement loop that elevates the overall quality of live chat support while recognizing and developing agent talent.
