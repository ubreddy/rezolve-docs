The Chats interface serves as the primary workspace for agents handling live conversations with users in Rezolve.ai. This intuitive interface is designed to maximize agent efficiency while ensuring high-quality support experiences for users.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Conversations**: Agents can handle up to five simultaneous conversations, allowing efficient support for multiple users without sacrificing quality.
- **Queue Organization**: The interface clearly organizes chats by queues, showing only the queues an agent is assigned to, which helps maintain focus and reduces confusion.
- **Availability Toggle**: A prominent availability toggle allows agents to easily update their status when they need to step away or return to taking chats.
- **Comprehensive Context**: The chat window provides comprehensive context for each conversation, including user information, conversation history, and relevant ticket details when applicable.
- **Typing Indicators**: Typing indicators show when users are composing messages, helping agents manage their workflow effectively.
- **File Sharing**: The interface supports file sharing, enabling both agents and users to exchange documents, screenshots, or images that may be helpful in resolving issues.
- **Canned Responses**: Agents can access canned responses—pre-written text snippets for common questions or scenarios—which can be quickly inserted and personalized before sending.
- **Automatic Suggestions**: The system provides automatic suggestions based on the conversation context, helping agents find relevant knowledge articles or previous solutions.
- **Queue-Based Routing**: Queue-based routing ensures that conversations are directed to the most appropriate agents based on skills, department, or other configurable criteria.
- **Chat Transfers**: When conversations require specialized knowledge, agents can easily transfer chats to colleagues or different queues while preserving the full conversation context.
- **Seamless Integration**: The Chats interface integrates seamlessly with other Rezolve.ai components, allowing agents to create tickets, access knowledge articles, or initiate automation workflows directly from the conversation window, creating a unified support experience that maximizes resolution efficiency.
