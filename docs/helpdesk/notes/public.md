# Public Notes

The Ticket Management System allows agents to add various types of notes to ensure proper documentation, communication, and tracking of ticket updates

Public notes are visible to both agents and end-users, making them ideal for sharing information that needs to be communicated to all parties involved in a ticket. These notes become part of the permanent ticket record and help maintain transparency throughout the support process.

These notes are visible to the requester and all team members. Public notes are typically used for providing updates, resolutions, or requesting additional information from the requester.
