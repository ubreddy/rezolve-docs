# Common Filters

1. **All Tickets**
   a. Displays all tickets available in the system, regardless of their status or assignment.

2. **All Assigned Tickets**
   a. Shows tickets that have been assigned to agents for resolution. Since the count is 0, no tickets are currently assigned.

3. **My Assigned Tickets**
   a. Lists tickets that are specifically assigned to the logged-in user. The 0 count indicates no tickets are assigned to them.

4. **Ticket as Watchers**
   a. Displays tickets where the user is added as a "Watcher," meaning they can monitor updates but may not have direct responsibility.

5. **Unassigned Tickets**
   a. Shows tickets that are yet to be assigned to an agent. These tickets need to be allocated to ensure resolution.

6. **My Submitted Tickets**
   a. Lists tickets that the logged-in user has submitted. This allows users to track requests or incidents they have raised.

7. **All Open Tickets**
   a. Filters tickets that are still open (not resolved or closed). These require action or resolution.

These filters help agents, requesters, and administrators efficiently manage and track tickets based on their role and responsibilities.
