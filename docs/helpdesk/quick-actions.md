# Quick Actions

The **Quick Actions** feature in the ticketing system provides users with a convenient way to perform common ticket-related tasks efficiently. This feature enhances user experience by reducing the number of steps required for frequent actions.

## Available Quick Actions

1. **Field Change** – Allows users to modify ticket fields, such as priority, status, category, or any custom fields configured in the system.

2. **Notes** – Enables users to add internal notes or comments for reference. These notes may be visible only to internal teams and do not notify external users.

3. **Add Actor** – Provides the ability to add new participants (actors) to the ticket, such as watchers (To/CC), additional assignees, or other stakeholders.

4. **Assign** – Quickly reassign tickets to different agents or teams based on expertise or workload.

5. **Merge** – Combine duplicate tickets into a single ticket to avoid redundant work and ensure consistent resolution.

6. **Link** – Connect related tickets to establish dependencies or relationships between issues.

7. **Bulk Actions** – Apply the same action to multiple tickets simultaneously, saving time when managing similar issues.
