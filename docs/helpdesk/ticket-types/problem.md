# Problem Management

## Overview

Problem Management is a key process in IT Service Management (ITSM) that focuses on identifying and addressing the root causes of recurring incidents. Unlike Incident Management, which deals with restoring services quickly, Problem Management aims to eliminate the underlying issues to prevent future disruptions.

A Problem Management Ticket is created when multiple incidents are reported that appear to have a common underlying cause. This ticket helps IT teams document, analyze, and resolve the root cause to improve system stability and efficiency.

## Problem Ticket Structure

### 1. General Ticket Details
- **Ticket ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., PMT-0047)
- **Ticket Type**: Problem Management
- **Status**: Various states (Submitted, In Progress, Resolved, etc.)
- **Subject**: Brief description of the problem
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the issue

### 2. Problem Information
- **Symptoms**: Error messages, impacted users, frequency of occurrence
- **Attachments**: Supporting documents, logs, or screenshots
