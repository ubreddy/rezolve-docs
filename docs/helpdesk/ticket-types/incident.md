# Incident Management

An Incident in IT Service Management (ITSM) refers to an unplanned disruption or reduction in the quality of an IT service. It could be caused by system failures, application errors, network issues, or security breaches that impact business operations. 

### Key Aspects of an Incident: 

- **Objective**: Restore normal service operation as quickly as possible with minimal disruption. 

- **Examples**:  
  - A website going down 
  - Email service outage 
  - A user unable to access a critical application 

- **Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High, and Critical (based on impact and urgency).
