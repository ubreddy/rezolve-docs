# Service Request Management

A **Service Request** refers to a formal user request for a service, information, or standard change within an IT system. Unlike incidents, service requests are planned and do not indicate service disruption or failure.

## Key Aspects of a Service Request:

- **Objective**: Fulfill user requests efficiently through predefined workflows.

- **Examples**:
  - Requesting access to an application
  - Resetting a password
  - Provisioning new hardware (e.g., a laptop)
  - Setting up a new email account

- **Resolution Process**:
  - **Request Submission** – User submits a request through the portal.
  - **Approval Workflow** – If required, approval is sought from relevant authorities.
  - **Fulfillment** – The requested service is delivered.
  - **Closure** – Request is marked as completed.
