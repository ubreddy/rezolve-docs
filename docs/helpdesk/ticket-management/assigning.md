Ticket assignment is a critical process in a ticket management system to ensure that the right team or agent handles an issue efficiently. Proper assignment leads to faster resolutions, reduced workload bottlenecks, and improved customer satisfaction.

### Manual Assignment

- An agent or administrator manually assigns a ticket to a specific agent or team.

### Auto-Assignment Based on Rules

- The system automatically assigns tickets based on predefined conditions such as:
  - **Category & Subcategory** (e.g., network issues go to the Networking team).
  - **Domain/Service** (e.g., HR-related requests assigned to the HR team).
  - **User Group** (e.g., VIP user tickets assigned to a premium support team).
