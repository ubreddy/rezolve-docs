# Bulk Operations

Enables managing multiple tickets simultaneously with the following actions:
- **Edit** – Modify fields such as priority, category, or assigned agent for multiple tickets at once.
- **State Transition** – Change the status (e.g., move all selected tickets to "Resolved").
- **Move Ticket** – Transfer tickets from one ticket type to another (useful when incorrect categories are assigned).
- **Delete** – Remove duplicate or invalid tickets in bulk.

### Steps to Perform Bulk Operations

1. **Select Tickets**

     - **Edit Issue**: Modify field values for selected tickets.
     - **Move Issue**: Change the location of selected tickets.
     - **Transitions**: Progress tickets through the workflow.
     - **Delete Issue**: Remove selected tickets permanently.

3. **Provide Operation Details**
   - If you select Edit Issue, you can update ticket fields in bulk.
   - If you select Move Issue, you'll need to specify the new category/location.
   - If you select Transitions, you'll choose the next workflow step.
   - If you select Delete Issue, a confirmation is required before deletion.
