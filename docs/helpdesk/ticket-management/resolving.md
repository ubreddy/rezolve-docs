# Resolving Tickets in a Ticket Management System

Resolving a ticket effectively ensures customer satisfaction and compliance with SLAs. It involves identifying the issue, applying a solution, updating records, and ensuring closure confirmation.

## Ticket Resolution Process

- Ticket Acknowledgment
- Issue Investigation
- Applying the Solution
- Verifying the Fix
- Updating the Ticket
- Ticket Closure

### Key Considerations in Ticket Resolution:

- **Priority & SLA Compliance**: Higher-priority tickets should be resolved faster to meet SLAs.
- **Resolution Notes**: A well-documented resolution helps in future troubleshooting.
- **Escalation Handling**: If an agent cannot resolve the issue, it should escalate efficiently.
- **Customer Feedback**: Gathering feedback ensures continuous improvement in resolution processes.
