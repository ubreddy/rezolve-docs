# Ticket Transitions

Ticket transitions provide several key benefits:

## Structured Movement
   - Enables seamless movement of tickets through different stages, such as:
     - Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
   - Ensures tickets follow a structured lifecycle for resolution.
   - Helps in tracking the status of each ticket.

## Common Transition States

- **Open**: Initial state when a ticket is created
- **In Progress**: Work has begun on the ticket
- **Pending**: Waiting for information or action from the requester
- **Resolved**: Solution has been implemented
- **Closed**: Ticket has been completed and verified

## Transition Rules

- Each ticket type may have different allowed transitions
- Some transitions may require specific conditions to be met
- Transitions can trigger automated actions such as:
  - **Email notifications**
  - **SLA clock adjustments**
  - **Assignment changes**

## Benefits of Structured Transitions

- **Provides clear visibility into ticket progress**
- **Ensures consistent handling of similar issues**
- **Facilitates accurate reporting and metrics**
- **Helps identify bottlenecks in the resolution process**
