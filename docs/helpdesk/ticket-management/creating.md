   c. **Problem Management**: Report recurring or major incidents.
   
   d. **Change Management**: Submit change requests for infrastructure or software.
   
   e. **Task**: Assign a task related to an existing request.

2. **Search & Filtering**:
   
   a. **search bar** allows users to find specific service offers.
   
   b. **favorites feature** lets users mark frequently used offers.

3. **Ticket Creation Process**:
   
   a. Clicking on an offer (e.g., "Incident") opens a **ticket creation form**.
   
   b. Users fill in required details and submit the request.
   
   c. The ticket is **automatically routed** based on predefined workflows.
