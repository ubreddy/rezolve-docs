# Ticket Priority and SLA

### SLA & Priority in Ticket Management System

The SLA (Service Level Agreement) and Priority settings play a crucial role in managing tickets efficiently within a ticket management system. These settings define how quickly a ticket should be responded to and resolved based on its urgency and impact.

### 1. SLA (Service Level Agreement)

An SLA is a predefined set of rules that dictate response and resolution times for different ticket types. It ensures that service requests are handled within a committed timeframe.

#### Key SLA Components:

- **Response Time**: The maximum time allowed for the first response.
- **Resolution Time**: The total time allowed to resolve the issue.
- **Breach Alerts**: Notifications triggered if an SLA is at risk of being breached.
- **Escalation Rules**: Actions taken if a ticket exceeds the SLA limit.

### 2. Priority in Ticketing System

The Priority level determines how quickly a ticket should be addressed. It is typically based on Impact (business disruption) and Urgency (time sensitivity).
