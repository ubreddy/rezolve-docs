# Ticket Filters

Ticket filters are a powerful way to organize, sort, and find specific tickets in the helpdesk system. They help improve efficiency and response times for agents and managers.

## Filters

1. Allows users to refine ticket lists based on specific criteria.
2. Common filters include status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed), priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical), assigned agent, category, ticket type, and creation date.
3. Helps agents focus on relevant tickets without scrolling through unnecessary entries.

### Types of Filters

- **Status Filters**: Open, Closed, Pending, In Progress
- **Priority Filters**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Category Filters**: Incident, Service Request, Problem, Change
- **Assignment Filters**: Assigned to Me, Unassigned, Assigned to Queue, Assigned to Agent
- **Time-Based Filters**: Created Today, Due Today, Overdue, Updated This Week
