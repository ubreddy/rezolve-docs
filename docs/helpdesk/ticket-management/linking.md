# Linking Tickets

Agents can link related tickets to manage dependencies and avoid duplicate resolutions. Linking tickets helps in:

- Connecting duplicate requests submitted by different users.
- Managing related tickets that are dependent on one another.
- Providing a unified resolution when multiple tickets address the same issue.

Once linked, agents can navigate between tickets easily, apply bulk actions, and ensure consistency in responses.
