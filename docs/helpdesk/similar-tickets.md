Agents can link related tickets to manage dependencies and avoid duplicate resolutions. Linking tickets helps in:

- Connecting duplicate requests submitted by different users
- Managing related tickets that are dependent on one another
- Providing a unified resolution when multiple tickets address the same issue

Once linked, agents can navigate between tickets easily, apply bulk actions, and ensure consistency in responses.

## Types of Ticket Relationships

### Parent-Child Relationship
- **Parent Ticket**: The main or original ticket that others depend on
- **Child Tickets**: Tickets that are dependent on the resolution of the parent ticket
- When the parent ticket is resolved, child tickets can be automatically updated

### Related Tickets
- Tickets that share information or context but don't have a direct dependency
- Useful for cross-referencing similar issues or solutions
- Helps in building knowledge base for recurring issues

### Linking Process

1. Open the ticket you want to link from
2. Navigate to the "Related Tickets" or "Links" section
3. Select the relationship type (Parent, Child, Related, Duplicate)
4. Search for and select the ticket(s) to link
5. Add a note explaining the relationship (optional)
6. Save the link
