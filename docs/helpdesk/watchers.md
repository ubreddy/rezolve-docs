In the ticketing system, the **Watchers** feature allows users to be notified about ticket updates and communications. Watchers can be added in two categories:

1. **To**: These are primary recipients who are directly involved in the ticket resolution process. They receive all ticket-related notifications and updates.
2. **CC**: These are additional recipients who are kept in the loop but may not be directly responsible for ticket resolution. They also receive notifications but are generally included for awareness.

## Adding a New User to the Ticket

- A new user (not originally associated with the ticket) can be added as a **Watcher** (either in To or CC).
- The newly added user will start receiving notifications about ticket progress, status changes, and comments.
- The system ensures proper permissions so only authorized users can add others as watchers.

This functionality enhances collaboration by keeping relevant stakeholders informed without requiring them to be assigned directly to the ticket.
