# Approval Workflows

## Approval Process

Approval workflows ensure that certain actions or requests go through proper authorization channels before implementation. This process maintains governance and compliance within the organization.

### Types of Approvals

1. **Change Request Approvals**: Required for system or infrastructure modifications
2. **Service Request Approvals**: For resource allocation or access permissions
3. **Purchase Approvals**: For procurement of hardware, software, or services
4. **Policy Exception Approvals**: For temporary exceptions to established policies

### Approval Workflow Steps

1. **Submission**: User submits a request requiring approval
2. **Routing**: System routes the request to appropriate approver(s)
3. **Notification**: Approvers receive notification of pending approval
4. **Review**: Approvers review the request details
5. **Decision**: Approvers approve, reject, or request more information
6. **Implementation**: Approved requests proceed to implementation
7. **Notification**: Requestor is notified of the approval decision

### Approval Levels

- **Single-level Approval**: One approver or group must authorize
- **Multi-level Approval**: Sequential approval by different authorities
- **Parallel Approval**: Multiple approvers can authorize simultaneously
- **Conditional Approval**: Approval routing based on specific criteria (cost, risk, etc.)

## Integration with Ticketing System

The Approval Workflow integrates seamlessly with the ticketing system to automate ticket approvals and status transitions.

### How the Integration Works

1. **Ticket Creation**:
   - A ticket is raised in the system by a user.
   - The ticket may require an approval process (e.g., Change Requests, Problem Management, or Incident Resolution).

2. **Approval Process Initiation**:
   - Based on the ticket type (e.g., Problem, Change, Request), the appropriate approval workflow is triggered.
   - The workflow state (e.g., Submitted, Awaiting Approval) is updated within the ticket.

3. **Approval & Decision**:
   - The assigned approvers review the ticket.
   - If approved, the ticket moves to the next stage (e.g., implementation, resolution).
   - If rejected or reopened, additional actions are required before re-submission.

4. **Ticket Closure**:
   - Once all approvals are completed, the ticket is marked as resolved/closed.

## Approver Actions

Approvers can take the following actions on tickets requiring their approval:

- **Approve**: Grant authorization for the request to proceed
- **Reject**: Deny the request with explanation
- **Request Information**: Ask for additional details before making a decision
- **Delegate**: Transfer approval authority to another qualified individual
- **Comment**: Add notes or conditions to the approval

## Approval Dashboard

The Approval Dashboard provides approvers with a centralized view of all requests awaiting their action.

### Dashboard Features

- **Pending Approvals**: List of all requests requiring action
- **Approval History**: Record of past approval decisions
- **Filters**: Options to sort by priority, date, type, etc.
- **Bulk Actions**: Ability to approve or reject multiple similar requests
- **Notifications**: Alerts for new or urgent approval requests
