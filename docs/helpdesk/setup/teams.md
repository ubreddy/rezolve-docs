# Teams Setup

## Overview

Rezolve.ai offers comprehensive Microsoft Teams integration options that allow organizations to seamlessly incorporate the virtual agent and additional support functionality directly into their Teams environment. This integration creates a unified experience where employees can access support services without leaving their primary collaboration platform.

The Teams integration can be configured in multiple ways to accommodate different organizational needs, security requirements, and deployment preferences.


## Integration Options

### Bot-Only Integration

The simplest integration approach involves sharing the Rezolve.ai bot application ID with employees, who can then add the bot to their Teams environment individually:

1. Rezolve.ai provides the organization with a bot application ID
2. This ID is shared with employees through internal communications
3. Employees add the bot to their Teams environment manually
4. The bot appears as a contact that users can message directly

This lightweight approach requires minimal IT involvement but puts the responsibility for installation on individual users, which may result in inconsistent adoption.

### Custom Package Deployment

For a more comprehensive and controlled integration, Rezolve.ai creates a custom Teams application package tailored to the organization's specific requirements:

Rezolve.ai develops a customized Teams application package including:
- The virtual agent bot
- Additional tabs and functionality as needed
- Organization-specific branding and naming
- Preconfigured permissions and scopes

The package includes:
- Custom thumbnail/icon
- Manifest file with JSON code
- Bot application ID and required configurations
- Tab configurations for additional functionality

The client's IT team deploys this package to their Teams app portal. Once deployed, the application becomes available for distribution within the organization.

This approach provides a consistent, branded experience with the exact functionality needed by the organization.


## Conclusion

The Rezolve.ai Teams integration provides a flexible, powerful way to bring AI-powered support directly into the collaboration platform where employees spend much of their workday. By offering multiple deployment options and extensive customization possibilities, organizations can create an integration strategy that aligns with their IT governance approach, user preferences, and support objectives.

Whether deploying to specific support teams, rolling out across the organization, or allowing user-driven adoption, the Teams integration ensures that employees have convenient access to support services without disrupting their workflow. This seamless experience increases adoption, improves support efficiency, and enhances the overall employee experience with support services.
