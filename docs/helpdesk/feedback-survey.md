The **Feedback and Survey** feature in your ticketing system allows end users, requesters, and reporters to provide feedback on resolved tickets. This process ensures service quality evaluation and helps in continuous improvement.

### Ways to Collect Feedback & Surveys

### 1. Through the Portal

a. Users can rate their experience with the ticket resolution directly within the ticketing system.

b. Rating options include **Good, Average, Poor, and Very Poor** (represented by stars).

c. Users can also add **Feedback Comments** for additional insights.

### 2. Through Email

a. Once a ticket is marked as **Resolved or Closed**, an email with a feedback survey link can be sent to the requester.

b. Users can provide ratings and comments via email without needing to log into the portal.
