**Q: How do I change the bot's name and profile picture?**  
A: Navigate to Bot Administration > Bot Profile Settings. From there, you can update the bot name, upload a new profile picture, and customize other aspects of the bot's identity.

**Q: Can different departments have their own customized bot configurations?**  
A: Yes, you can create audience-specific configurations for certain aspects of the bot. Additionally, you can deploy separate bot instances with different configurations if necessary for distinct departmental needs.

**Q: How do I control what information the bot can access?**  
A: Knowledge source access is managed through the Knowledge Management section. You can enable or disable specific sources and apply audience restrictions to control who can access different types of information.

**Q: Can I temporarily disable the bot across all channels?**  
A: Yes, in Bot Administration > Settings, there is a global activation toggle that can disable the bot across all channels. You can also disable individual channels as needed.

**Q: How do I update the bot when our policies or procedures change?**  
A: Update the relevant knowledge sources (documents, articles) with the new information. The bot will automatically use the updated content for future responses. For significant changes, you may want to review and update any scripted answers as well.

**Q: How can I monitor bot performance and usage?**  
A: The Analytics section provides comprehensive dashboards and reports on bot usage, performance, and user satisfaction. You can set up scheduled reports to receive regular updates on key metrics.

**Q: How do I control who can administer the bot?**  
A: User roles and permissions are managed through the User Management section of the Admin app. Assign appropriate roles (Bot Admin, Bot Manager, etc.) to control who can make changes to different aspects of the bot configuration.

**Q: How do I integrate the bot with our single sign-on system?**  
A: Authentication configuration is available in the Bot Administration > Settings section. You can configure integration with popular identity providers or custom SSO solutions.

**Q: Can external users access the bot without having accounts in our system?**  
A: Yes, the Guest User Settings allow you to create secure access paths for external users without requiring tenant membership. This is ideal for contractors, customers, or partners who need occasional assistance.

**Q: How do I deploy the bot to a new channel?**  
A: Navigate to Bot Administration > Channels, select the channel you want to add, and follow the guided setup process. Each channel has specific configuration requirements detailed in its setup documentation.
