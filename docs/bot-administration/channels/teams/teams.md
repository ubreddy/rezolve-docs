# Microsoft Teams


### Channels Configuration

The Channels section of Bot Administration allows you to configure and manage the various platforms where your Rezolve.ai virtual agent is deployed. Each channel has unique characteristics and configuration requirements that enable the bot to function optimally within that environment.

Rezolve.ai supports multiple deployment channels to meet users where they work, providing consistent support experiences regardless of how users choose to interact with the virtual agent. The platform's multi-channel architecture ensures that core knowledge and capabilities are available across all channels while adapting to the unique interface requirements of each platform.

From this section, administrators can:
- Enable or disable specific channels
- Configure channel-specific settings
- Manage authentication methods
- Customize the appearance and behavior of the bot within each environment

This centralized management approach ensures consistent experiences while honoring the unique characteristics of each platform.

### Microsoft Teams Integration

Microsoft Teams integration brings Rezolve.ai's virtual agent directly into the collaborative environment where many employees spend their workday. The Teams channel leverages Microsoft's bot framework and adaptive cards to create a seamless, native-feeling experience within the Teams interface.

#### Key Features
- Direct messaging with the bot within Teams
- Rich adaptive card interfaces for interactive experiences
- Authentication through Microsoft's security framework
- Optional additional components like notification tabs and ticket management
- Support for both mobile and desktop Teams clients

#### Deployment Models
- Individual user installation through the Teams store
- Organization-wide deployment by administrators
- Custom app package with specialized capabilities
- Policy-based deployment to specific user groups

When properly configured, the Teams integration provides a seamless support experience that allows users to get assistance without leaving their primary collaboration platform.
