# Packages Overview

## Deploying in Production

Package is a concept that would allow to pick and choose the components and flows that need to be deployed in the target environment.

### Deploying Individual Components

The Deploy Component button allows you to deploy an individual Card, Script, Slot, API, or API Server directly to the Production Folder without needing to create a Deployment Package. Only components that are in a WIP (Work in Progress) state can be deployed individually.
