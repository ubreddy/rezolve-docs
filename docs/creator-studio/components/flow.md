# Flow Components

Flows are components that the bot can run to automate a task or lead the end-user through a scripted experience. Every interaction in the bot is done through a flow. Flows themselves are made up of various other components, such as Cards, APIs, or Scripts.

By default, several flows are automatically populated into a tenant upon tenant registration. These flows comprise the basic, out-of-box feature sets offered by Rezolve.ai.

When creating a flow, you'll be asked to enter a name for the flow. Upon clicking **Create**, your flow will exist in a draft status and will not be added to the list of flows on the left until after you add at least 1 component and click **Save**.
