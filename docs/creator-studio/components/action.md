# Action Components

The action component allows users to create a new action that can validate the data to be added to the flow. **Actions** contain both scripts and APIs that can be part of the action as action types.

## Action Types

### Action Type as Script
Actions that are added require scripts that can validate the data and process the variables that can be obtained from fields.

Restricted scripts are scripts that are designed and ingested through backend files which provide routing for the Action to execute the file name from the backend. Once the user enables the toggle switch, the user is asked to enter the file name to be fetched.

### Action Type as API
Actions can also carry APIs that are created from Creator Studio. The API can be placed in any flow with the use of an Action.
