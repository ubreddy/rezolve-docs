# Creator Studio FAQs

### Do I need to know how to code to use the AI Creator Studio?

Nope! While javascript is available to those who would like to use it, Creator Studio is built from the ground-up to not require the use of coding or scripting. Our simple drag-and-drop interface offers common tools to lower the barrier of entry.

### What happens if I accidentally deploy an automation that wasn't ready?

CreatorStudio offers a simple Rollback feature within the Deployments menu that allows you to instantly roll back any mistakenly deployed packages.

### How do I know if I can use Creator Studio to integrate with my product?

Creator Studio broadly supports REST API. As long as the product you're trying to integrate with offers a REST API, you can build an automation that utilizes it.

### How can I track changes made to my flows and components?

Creator Studio includes a comprehensive Audit History feature that tracks all modifications to flows and components. You can access this through the Studio History menu, which shows who made changes, when they were made, and what was modified. The **Show Diff button** allows you to compare different versions side-by-side, making it easy to track changes and restore previous versions if needed.
