# Audit History

Each time a flow or component is modified, the change is tracked in the Studio History menu. This History menu can be used to track changes made by multiple users or to restore a previous version of an individual component or flow.

From here you can view the most recently modified components, who updated them, when they were last updated, and what aspects of the components were modified. You can filter the list by entering the name of an individual component, setting a component type to sort by, or selecting a date range. You can refresh the screen using a refresh button on the right corner of history screen.

Upon clicking a component, you'll be taken to a page that contains the current version of that component. You can also reach this menu by clicking the clock icon found in every component.

To view and/or restore a previous version of that component, click the History tab in the top right corner.

The History menu shows a list of all recorded changes made to that individual component and allows you to compare changes using the **Show Diff button**. The Show Diff button provides a side-by-side comparison of the changes made between two versions of a component, highlighting the differences in a clear and readable format. This feature enables you to easily identify and review the changes made to a component, making it easier to track and manage updates.
