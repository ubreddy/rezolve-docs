GETTING STARTED
Welcome to your Admin Portal!!! In this manual, we will take a quick look at the various Admin task an Admin will
have to complete.
Navigation Pane
The Navigation menu can be always be found on the left side of your screen except when using the Virtual Agent
section.

• Interactions - gives you an overview of the number of chats with the bot
• Question Answered - questions the bot answered
• Size of Knowledge Base - how many dialogues the bot is trained on
• System Users - number of users who have accounts to access the bot in the portal
In the next section, the table looks at the number of chats and how many questions the bot has been asked by
date. We differentiate the two since in one chat a user can ask multiple questions.

You can filter the view by:
• Week
• Month
• 12 Month
• All
Simply click on the filter you would like to apply.
In the next section, a pie graph and multiple tables.
The Performance pie graph shows you how many chats the user said the answer was helpful or not helpful by
date.

on yet by date.

feedback with a star rating and comments. This graph looks at the star rating by date.
