After completing the Single Sign On (SSO) setup, if you would like the bot to have access to additional attributes in the
web widget you will need to enable additional configuration in Azure. Please follow the steps outlined below to do
this:
1. Open Azure Portal and select Azure Active Directory
2. Go to Enterprise applications
3. Search for your RezolveHelpdeskBot app (or whatever you called it) you created for SSO setup and select
it.
4. Click Single sign-on

1. Look for User Attributes & Claims and select Edit

6. Select Add New
7. On the Manage user claims page, give the attribute a display name (there can be no spaces)
8. Find and select the attribute from the Source attribute dropdown
Hint: If you do not know the attribute is called in Azure, look up someoneâ€™s account and see what the field is
called.
9. Click Save
10. Keep adding attribute accesses until done
11. Take a screenshot of all the attributes the RezolveHelpdeskBot app now has access to from the Single
sign-on page
