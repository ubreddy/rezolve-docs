### Knowledge Insights & Performance Metrics
- **Successful Responses Rate**: Measures how often the bot provides an accurate and useful answer to user queries.
- **Unrecognized Utterances**: Tracks how many users queries the bot failed to respond to due to missing or incorrect knowledge.
- **Knowledge Source Utilization**: Analyzes which knowledge sources (Documents, SharePoint, External Websites, Knowledge Articles) are being referenced by the chatbot.
- **Escalation Trends**: Measures how frequently users escalate queries to a live agent due to dissatisfaction with both responses.
- **Response Accuracy Analysis**: Evaluates how many chatbot responses match the expected answers in the knowledge base.

### Identifying & Addressing Knowledge Gaps
- Any failed utterances (user questions that the bot couldn't answer) are recorded under Knowledge Gaps.
- The analyst can review these knowledge gaps and determine if:
  - The knowledge base needs to be updated with new information.
  - Existing knowledge articles require refinements for better accuracy.
  - The bot requires additional training to improve response effectiveness.
- Provides an option to mark an utterance for training, allowing AI models to learn and adapt to user queries more effectively.

### Performance Breakdown by Knowledge Category
- The chatbot's knowledge base is divided into categories such as FAQs, Online Forms, Featured Questions, Software Requests, and Hardware Requests.
- Analysts can evaluate which categories are performing well and which require further enhancement.
- This breakdown helps in understanding user preferences and optimizing chatbot responses accordingly.
