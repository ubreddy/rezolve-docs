## Browse Service Catalog - Functional Overview

The Service Catalog is an organized collection of service requests that users can browse and select based on their needs. Under the Browse Service Catalog menu, there are three key sections:

### 1. Favorites ‚≠ê

- This section allows users to bookmark frequently used services for quick access.
- Marking an offer as a favorite helps reduce search time and improves efficiency.
- Users can easily access their most-used services without navigating through multiple categories.

### 2. Offers Within Intents üìÇ

- This section categorizes service offers into structured intents based on user needs.
- Each intent groups relevant service requests to simplify navigation.
- Examples of intents:
  - Incidents (ITSM): Likely includes incident-related requests.
  - Requests: A general category for various service requests.
  - IT: Services related to IT support, such as software installations or system access.
  - CSM: Possibly related to Customer Service Management.

**Key Benefit:** Organizing offers into intents ensures users can quickly find the right service request category without searching manually.

### 3. Others (Offers Without Intents) üìÅ

- This section contains unmapped services that are not yet assigned to an intent.
- The offers listed here may be newly created or not categorized properly.
- Administrators can later map these services to relevant intents for better organization.

**Key Benefit:** This acts as a temporary holding section for offers that need further classification, ensuring no service request is lost.

### Overall Benefits of the Browse Service Catalog Menu:

‚úÖ **Enhanced Navigation** - Categorization into Favorites, Intents, and Others improves user experience.

‚úÖ **Faster Access** - Users can quickly locate frequently used or relevant service requests.

‚úÖ **Better Organization** - Offers are neatly arranged, and unassigned ones can be categorized later.
