# Knowledge Workflow Management

This guide explains how to implement effective workflows for knowledge content creation, review, approval, publication, and maintenance to ensure high-quality, up-to-date information.

## Understanding Knowledge Workflows

Knowledge workflows are structured processes that:

- Guide content through its lifecycle stages
- Ensure consistent quality and accuracy
- Involve the right stakeholders at each stage
- Track progress and accountability
- Maintain content freshness and relevance

## Setting Up Basic Workflows

### Default Workflow Templates

The system includes several pre-configured workflow templates:

1. **Simple Workflow**: Draft → Review → Publish
2. **Standard Workflow**: Draft → Technical Review → Editorial Review → Publish
3. **Compliance Workflow**: Draft → Technical Review → Legal Review → Compliance Approval → Publish
4. **Translation Workflow**: Draft → Translation → Local Review → Publish

To select a workflow template:
1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Workflows** > **Templates**
2. Review available templates
3. Select a template to use as your starting point
4. Customize as needed for your organization

### Custom Workflow Creation

Create a custom workflow tailored to your needs:

1. Go to **Admin** > **Workflows** > **Create New**
2. Define workflow stages:
   - Add each required stage
   - Set stage properties (required/optional, time limits)
   - Configure transitions between stages
3. Assign roles for each stage:
   - Who can work on content at this stage
   - Who can approve transitions
   - Who receives notifications
4. Set up automation rules (optional):
   - Auto-assignment based on content properties
   - Time-based escalations
   - Conditional paths
5. Save and activate the workflow

### Stage Transitions

Configure how content moves between stages:

1. Go to **Admin** > **Workflows** > **Transitions**
2. For each transition, define:
   - Who can initiate the transition
   - Required conditions (all reviews complete, minimum rating)
   - Automatic transitions (time-based, condition-based)
   - Notifications and alerts
   - Required documentation (comments, change logs)

## Role-Based Workflow Assignments

### Workflow Roles

Define the roles involved in your knowledge workflows:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Workflows** > **Roles**
2. Configure standard roles:
   - **Authors**: Create initial content
   - **Technical Reviewers**: Verify technical accuracy
   - **Editors**: Ensure clarity and consistency
   - **Subject Matter Experts**: Provide specialized knowledge
   - **Approvers**: Give final sign-off
   - **Publishers**: Control publication timing and channels
3. Create custom roles specific to your organization
4. Define role permissions and capabilities

### Assignment Rules

Configure how work is assigned:

1. Go to **Admin** > **Workflows** > **Assignments**
2. Set up assignment methods:
   - Manual assignment by managers
   - Auto-assignment based on content properties
   - Round-robin distribution
   - Workload-balanced assignment
   - Self-assignment from queues
3. Configure assignment rules for each content type and category
4. Set up backup and escalation paths

## Workflow Automation

### Automated Transitions

Set up conditions for automatic stage transitions:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Workflows** > **Automation**
2. Configure transition triggers:
   - Time-based (move to next stage after X days)
   - Activity-based (all reviewers have commented)
   - Quality-based (minimum rating achieved)
   - External events (product release, policy change)

### Notifications and Reminders

Configure the notification system:

1. Go to **Admin** > **Workflows** > **Notifications**
2. Set up notification types:
   - Assignment notifications
   - Due date reminders
   - Overdue alerts
   - Stage transition notifications
   - Completion notifications
3. Configure delivery channels:
   - In-app notifications
   - Email alerts
   - Integration with messaging platforms
   - Mobile push notifications
4. Set notification frequency and escalation rules

### Workflow Integrations

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

- **Start simple**: Begin with basic workflows and add complexity as needed
- **Focus on value**: Eliminate steps that don't improve quality
- **Balance speed and quality**: Find the right level of review for your content
- **Consider content types**: Different content may need different workflows
- **Plan for exceptions**: Create bypass mechanisms for urgent content

### Implementation

- **Pilot test**: Start with a small content area before full deployment
- **Train participants**: Ensure everyone understands their roles
- **Gather feedback**: Continuously improve based on user experience
- **Document processes**: Create clear guidelines for each workflow
- **Monitor compliance**: Ensure workflows are being followed correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Content stuck in workflow | Implement escalation paths and time-based transitions |
| Reviewer bottlenecks | Add backup reviewers and workload balancing |
| Workflow bypassing | Improve emergency procedures and track exceptions |
| Excessive revisions | Clarify requirements earlier in the process |
