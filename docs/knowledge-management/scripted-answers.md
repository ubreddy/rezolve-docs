# Scripted Answers in Knowledge Management

Scripted Articles represent a cornerstone of Rezolve.ai | Next-Gen ITSM & HR Support | Agentic AI-Powered Automation 's knowledge management approach, providing precisely controlled responses for situations where exact wording, formatting, and presentation are essential. Unlike their Non-Scripted counterparts that allow for AI-generated variations, Scripted Articles deliver word-for-word responses exactly as authored, ensuring consistency and compliance in critical information delivery.

This powerful component of the knowledge base is particularly valuable for technical instructions, compliance information, policy statements, and other content where precision is paramount. Rezolve.ai | Next-Gen ITSM & HR Support | Agentic AI-Powered Automation  provides comprehensive tools for creating, managing, and optimizing Scripted Articles to ensure the Virtual Agent delivers exactly the right information in exactly the right way.
