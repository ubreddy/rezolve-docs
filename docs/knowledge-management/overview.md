# Overview

Rezolve.ai's virtual agent operates on a vector-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture that enables comprehensive grounding in your organization's knowledge base. This architecture allows the virtual agent to access and utilize relevant information when responding to employee queries.

The Knowledge Management section provides administrators with tools to configure and maintain various knowledge sources that the virtual agent references when answering questions. By properly configuring these knowledge sources, you ensure that the virtual agent delivers accurate, contextually relevant responses based on your organization's specific information.

## Available Knowledge Sources

The virtual agent can access information from several different types of knowledge repositories:

- **SharePoint Repositories**: Connect to your organization's SharePoint sites to utilize documents, pages, and files stored there
- **Crawled URLs**: Import knowledge from specified web pages and websites
- **Documents**: Upload individual files directly into the knowledge base
- **Knowledge Articles**: Create and manage custom knowledge articles directly within the platform

Through effective knowledge management, administrators can ensure that the virtual agent has access to the most current and relevant information, improving the accuracy and usefulness of its responses to employee queries.
