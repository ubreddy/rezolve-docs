- **Test in context**: Evaluate knowledge in realistic usage scenarios

### Implementation

- **Start small**: Begin with critical content areas
- **Document findings**: Create clear records of test results
- **Close the loop**: Ensure test findings lead to improvements
- **Retest after changes**: Verify that improvements are effective
- **Share insights**: Distribute testing learnings to content creators
