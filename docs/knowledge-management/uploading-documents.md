- **Enhanced OCR**: Higher accuracy for complex documents (requires additional processing time)
- **Language-Specific OCR**: Optimized for documents in specific languages
- **Layout Preservation**: Attempts to maintain original document layout

### Content Structuring

Options for structuring extracted content:

- **Header Hierarchy**: Preserves heading levels for better navigation

### Metadata Extraction

- **Custom Field Mapping**: Map document properties to custom metadata fields

## Post-Upload Processing

After uploading documents, you can perform additional processing:

### Content Enrichment

- **Auto-Tagging**: Automatically generate tags based on content analysis
- **Entity Extraction**: Identify and tag people, organizations, and locations
- **Related Content Linking**: Automatically link to related articles
- **Summary Generation**: Create automatic summaries of long documents

### Quality Checks

- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify potential duplicate content
- **Broken Link Detection**: Find and fix broken links in the document
- **Readability Analysis**: Assess content readability and suggest improvements
- **Formatting Consistency**: Check for consistent formatting

## Organizing Uploaded Documents

### Categorization

- Assign documents to one or multiple categories
- Create new categories during the upload process
- Use auto-categorization based on content analysis

### Tagging

- Apply tags to make documents more discoverable
- Use suggested tags based on content analysis
- Create tag hierarchies for better organization

### Versioning

- Enable version control for documents
- Upload new versions of existing documents
- View and restore previous versions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Upload Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| File too large | Files over 100MB may need to be split or compressed |
| Unsupported format | Convert to a supported format before uploading |
| Poor OCR quality | Use Enhanced OCR or pre-process scanned documents |
| Upload timeout | Use chunked upload for large files |

### Processing Errors

If document processing fails:

1. Check the error message in the notification
2. Verify the file is not corrupted
3. Try converting to a different format
4. Contact support if issues persist

## Best Practices

- **Pre-process documents** for optimal results:
  - Ensure good scan quality for physical documents
  - Use consistent formatting in source documents
  - Remove unnecessary headers, footers, and watermarks
- **Organize before uploading**:
  - Develop a consistent naming convention
  - Structure folders logically if using folder upload
  - Prepare metadata in advance for bulk uploads
- **Post-upload verification**:
  - Review extracted content for accuracy
  - Verify metadata and categorization
  - Check search functionality with the new documents
