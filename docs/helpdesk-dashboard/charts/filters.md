## Benefits of Using Filters

- **Faster Data Retrieval** – Quickly access relevant insights
- **Enhanced Decision-Making** – Prioritize critical issues effectively
- **Better Performance Monitoring** – Track efficiency across teams
- **Customizable Insights** – Adjust views based on user roles and needs

The Dashboard Filter Function streamlines service management, ensuring data-driven decisions and improved issue resolution.

## Key Functionalities

- Helps drill down data for better analysis
- Applied across dashboard components to refine reports
- Enables users to focus on relevant metrics efficiently

## Types of Filters & Details

### Date Range
Filter by specific time periods (e.g., last 7 days, last month).

### Ticket Status
Sort by Open, In Progress, Resolved, Escalated, or Closed tickets.

### Priority Level
Focus on Low, Medium, High, or Critical priority tickets.

### Ticket Category
Group tickets by type (IT Support, HR Request, Customer Inquiry, etc.).

### Assigned Team/Agent
View tickets assigned to specific teams or individuals.

### Customer/Requester
Display tickets submitted by a particular user or department.


### SLA Compliance
Identify tickets that met or violated service-level agreements.

## Using Filters Effectively

### Combining Multiple Filters

Users can apply multiple filters simultaneously to narrow down data even further. For example:
- High-priority tickets assigned to the IT team in the last week
- Unresolved tickets from a specific department that are approaching SLA breach
- Tickets resolved by a particular agent within 24 hours

### Saving Filter Configurations

Frequently used filter combinations can be saved for quick access in future sessions, allowing users to:
- Create personalized views based on role responsibilities
- Set up team-specific dashboards for focused monitoring
- Develop executive summaries with relevant KPIs

### Filter-Based Alerts

Configure alerts based on specific filter conditions to proactively address issues:
- Notification when high-priority tickets remain unresolved for more than 4 hours
- Alert when SLA compliance drops below a defined threshold
- Warning when ticket volume in a specific category exceeds normal levels

## Best Practices for Filter Usage

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with wider date ranges and fewer filters, then add more specific criteria as needed
2. **Consistent Comparisons**: Use the same filter settings when comparing performance across different time periods
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess which filters provide the most valuable insights for your role
4. **Team Standardization**: Establish standard filter sets for specific roles to ensure consistent reporting
5. **Filter Documentation**: Keep notes on which filter combinations revealed important insights for future reference
