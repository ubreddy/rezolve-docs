# Pie Chart

Pie and donut charts are used to represent the proportion of different categories within a dataset. They help visualize how a whole is divided into parts, making it easy to identify dominant segments.

## Key Features

- **Proportional Representation**: Shows the percentage share of each category.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Helps compare distribution among different channels, teams, or ticket types.
- **Customizable Filters**: Can be filtered by date, ticket type, priority, etc.
- **Clear & Intuitive View**: Ideal for understanding ticket distribution briefly.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Ticket Distribution by Channel
- The chart displays how tickets are distributed across different channels (Email, Chat, Phone, social media).
- Helps support teams identify the most used customer service channels.

### 2. Issue Type Breakdown
- Shows different types of issues (e.g., Bug Reports, Feature Requests, Access Issues).
- Helps in categorizing recurring problems and prioritizing resolutions.

### 3. Bot Conversations by Channel
- As seen in the image, the chart visualizes bot conversations across different platforms (e.g., Website, Mobile App, WhatsApp).
- Useful for analyzing chatbot engagement across multiple channels.

## Configuration in Dashboard

- **Chart Type**: Pie / Donut
- **Show**: Count / Percentage
- **x-Axis**: Source (e.g., Channel, Issue Type, Department)
- **Filters**: 
  - Example: "Ticket Type is Conversation" (filters data to only show bot conversations)
