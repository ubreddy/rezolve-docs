# Summary Table

The Summary Table provides a structured overview of ticket data, helping users analyze trends and prioritize tasks effectively. This powerful visualization tool organizes ticket information in a tabular format, making it easy to identify patterns and track performance metrics.

## Key Columns in the Summary Table

The table consists of the following fields:

- **Created At (by days)**: Groups tickets by the day they were created
- **Ticket ID**: Unique identifier for each ticket
- **Priority (H/M/L)**: Represents ticket priority (High, Medium, Low)
- **Status**: Indicates whether the ticket is in To Do, In Progress, or Done status

## Aggregated Fields

The Aggregated Fields section shows how the ticket data is summarized:

### Priority Aggregation
- The table counts the number of tickets by priority (High, Medium, Low)
- The alias for this field is Priority(H/M/L)

### Status Aggregation
- Tickets are categorized based on their status: To Do, In Progress, and Done
- The alias for this field is S (T/I/D) (standing for To Do / In Progress / Done)

## Grouping & Sorting

- The table is grouped by Created At (formatted by days) and Ticket ID
- Sorting options allow for arranging data by different fields if needed
- Users can adjust grouping to focus on specific time periods or ticket attributes

## Customization & Filters

- Users can add more fields to aggregate and display additional insights
- Filters can be applied based on specific field conditions, allowing for a more refined dataset
- Column visibility can be adjusted to focus on the most relevant information

## Creating and Configuring Summary Tables

1. **Select Data Source**: Choose the ticket data source to populate the table
2. **Define Columns**: Select which fields to display as columns
3. **Set Aggregations**: Determine how data should be counted or summarized
4. **Apply Grouping**: Group data by relevant dimensions (date, priority, status, etc.)
5. **Add Filters**: Apply filters to focus on specific subsets of data
6. **Format Display**: Adjust column widths, sorting, and visual formatting

## Best Practices

- **Keep It Focused**: Include only the most relevant columns to avoid information overload
- **Consistent Grouping**: Maintain consistent grouping criteria for easier trend analysis
- **Regular Updates**: Refresh data regularly to ensure current information
- **Export Options**: Configure export settings for sharing reports with stakeholders
- **Saved Views**: Create and save different table configurations for various analysis needs
