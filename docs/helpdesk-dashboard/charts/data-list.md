## What This Chart Represents

A Data Table Chart provides a structured breakdown of ticket attributes, giving granular details about each ticket. This is useful for tracking individual records rather than just summarized metrics.

## Key Use Cases

- **Detailed Ticket Monitoring**: Allows help desk teams to track tickets with attributes such as priority, assigned agent, and feedback ratings.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates how quickly tickets are being handled by sorting them based on created time or priority.
- **User and Agent Tracking**: Identifies which agents are handling the most tickets and how users are interacting with the support system.
- **Response Time Insights**: If response times are included, it can help identify SLA breaches or delays.
- **Quality Assessment**: With feedback ratings, managers can assess customer satisfaction for different agents or ticket categories.

## How Each Column Helps

| Column Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Assigned To | Shows which agent or team is handling the ticket. |
| Created At | Indicates when the ticket was created, useful for tracking resolution time. |
| Created By | Identifies the user who raised the ticket, allowing user-specific insights. |
| Feedback Rating | Captures customer feedback, helping assess support quality. |
| Object Id | A unique identifier for tracking specific tickets. |
| Priority | Helps sort and filter tickets based on urgency (High, Medium, Low). |

## Customization & Enhancements

- **Filters**: Apply filters such as date range, priority, or category to refine the data.
- **Sorting Options**: Change sorting to "Descending" for the most recent tickets first.
- **Additional Columns**: Add fields like "Status," "Response Time," or "Category" for more in-depth analysis.
- **Export Feature**: If available, exporting the table to Excel or CSV can help in reporting and offline analysis.

## Additional Features for Data Table Charts

1. **Edit Chart**
   - Allows users to modify the chart settings, including columns, filters, sorting, and other configurations.
   - Useful for making quick updates without creating a new chart from scratch.

2. **Unit Conversions**
   - If applicable, this feature enables conversion of data values from one unit to another (e.g., time formats, currency, or measurement units).
   - Helps in maintaining consistency in reporting when working with multiple units.

3. **Export as CSV**
   - Allows users to download the table data in CSV format for offline analysis.
   - Beneficial for sharing reports, conducting further analysis in Excel, or integrating with other tools.

4. **Subscribe as CSV**
   - Users can subscribe to receive the latest data in CSV format at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - Automates reporting and ensures that users always have up-to-date information without manually exporting data.

5. **Duplicate Chart**
   - Creates a copy of the existing chart with the same configuration.
   - Useful for making modifications to a chart without altering the original version.

6. **Delete**
   - Permanently removes the chart from the dashboard.
   - Ensures unwanted or outdated charts do not clutter the dashboard.

## Best Practices for Using Data List Charts

1. **Apply Relevant Filters**: Start with broader data and then apply filters to focus on specific issues or trends.
2. **Choose Essential Columns**: Include only the most relevant columns to avoid information overload.
3. **Set Appropriate Sorting**: Sort by priority for urgent issues or by creation date for chronological analysis.
4. **Regular Exports**: Schedule regular exports for reporting to stakeholders or for archival purposes.
5. **Combine with Summary Charts**: Use alongside summary charts to provide both detailed and high-level views of your ticket data.
