A Grouped Bar Chart is used to compare multiple variables side by side. Each group represents a category, and within each category, there are multiple bars representing different subcategories.

## Use Case in Ticketing Dashboard:

* Comparing ticket trends across multiple agents, locations, or departments.
* Analyzing ticket resolution time for different teams.
* Tracking ticket priority levels (Low, Medium, High) across different months or weeks.

## Example in a Ticketing System:

* X-Axis: Category (e.g., Ticket Type â€“ Hardware, Software, Network).
* Y-Axis: Count of Tickets.
* Grouping: By Agent or Location (each group will have multiple bars per agent or location).
