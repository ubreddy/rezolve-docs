# Helpdesk Dashboard FAQs

### What is the Helpdesk Dashboard?
The Helpdesk Dashboard is a centralized platform for efficiently managing service requests, incidents, and support tickets. It provides real-time updates, automated workflows, and insightful analytics to help track and resolve issues through an intuitive interface.

### How do I access the Dashboard?
The Dashboard can be accessed through the web interface, mobile app, email integration, or API connections for system integration.

### Can I customize my Dashboard?
Yes, you can customize your Dashboard by selecting widgets, arranging layouts, setting data filters, and configuring refresh rates to suit your specific needs.


### What types of charts are available in the Dashboard?
The Dashboard offers various chart types including:
- Bar and Stacked Bar Charts for distribution comparisons
- Pie and Donut Charts for category visualization
- Line and Series Charts for trend tracking
- Grouped Bar Charts for multi-variable comparisons
- Data List Charts for detailed ticket information
- Number Charts for key metrics
- Summary Tables for data breakdowns

### How do I use the Grouped Bar Chart?
Grouped Bar Charts allow you to compare multiple variables side by side. Each group represents a category with multiple bars representing subcategories. They're ideal for comparing ticket trends across agents, analyzing resolution times for different teams, or tracking priority levels across time periods.

### What's the difference between a Pie Chart and a Bar Chart?
Pie Charts are best for showing proportional data and part-to-whole relationships, while Bar Charts excel at comparing values across different categories. Use Pie Charts when you need to identify dominant segments, and Bar Charts when you need to make precise comparisons between categories.

### How can I export data from the Dashboard?
You can export data in multiple formats:
1. PDF Format: For visually formatted, printable documents
2. CSV Format: For structured data analysis
3. Excel Format: For native spreadsheet functionality
4. Scheduled Exports: For automated reporting

To export, navigate to the dashboard, click the "Export" button, select your format, configure options, and download the file.

### Can I schedule regular reports?
Yes, you can set up subscription reports to be delivered automatically. The system allows you to configure reports with or without filters, set delivery schedules, and specify recipients including Queue Members, Agents, Supervisors, or specific Users/Roles.


### How do I track agent performance?
The Agent Performance section provides metrics including:
- Tickets Assigned and Resolved
- Average Resolution Time
- Response Time
- SLA Compliance
- Customer Satisfaction
- First Contact Resolution Rate

You can view individual agent metrics or compare performance across teams.

### What are ticket transitions?
Ticket transitions are structured processes for moving tickets through different stages (e.g., Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed). They help maintain visibility, consistency, and proper tracking throughout the ticket lifecycle.

### How do I link related tickets?
You can link tickets to manage dependencies and avoid duplicate resolutions. The system supports parent-child relationships, related tickets, and duplicate tickets. To link tickets, follow the six-step process outlined in the documentation, selecting the appropriate relationship type.

### Can I create a dashboard for specific ticket types?
Yes, you can create Custom Dashboards for Single Ticket Types that provide focused insights on specific ticket categories. These specialized views help you monitor, manage, and optimize the handling of particular ticket types.

### How do I personalize my view?
You can personalize your view by customizing the list view (selecting columns, arranging column order), adjusting theme settings, customizing dashboard widgets, setting notification preferences, and configuring keyboard shortcuts.

### What filtering options are available?
The system offers various filter types including Status filters, Priority filters, Category filters, Assignment filters, and Time-Based filters. You can create custom filters, save them for future use, and share them with team members.
