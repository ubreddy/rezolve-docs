# Subscriptions

The **Subscription Report** is a scheduled report that provides detailed insights based on selected parameters. It can be configured with or without filters and is sent via email to designate recipients, such as Queue Members, Agents, Supervisors, or specific Users/Roles.

## Types of Subscription Reports

1. **With Filters**:
   a. Allows users to customize reports based on predefined filters (e.g., date range, agent performance, queue statistics, etc.).
   b. Ensures recipients receive only relevant data based on their selection criteria.

2. **Without Filters**:
   a. Generates a complete report covering all available data without applying any filters.
   b. Provides a holistic view of performance metrics or queue activities.
