# Groups Management

Groups are used to group users together for access control and resource management.

Groups provide a way to organize users for easier management and permission assignment:

- **Group Creation**: Establish collections of users based on department, function, or other criteria
- **Membership Management**: Add or remove users from groups individually or in bulk
- **Nested Groups**: Create hierarchical group structures when needed
- **Permission Assignment**: Apply permissions at the group level rather than to individual users
- **Dynamic Groups**: Configure groups that automatically update based on user attributes
