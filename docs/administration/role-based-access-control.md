# Role-Based Access Control

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the platform's role-based access control (RBAC) system, helping administrators effectively manage user permissions and security.

## RBAC Overview

### Understanding RBAC
- Core principles of role-based access
- Benefits of RBAC implementation
- Security and compliance advantages
- Operational efficiency improvements
- Scalability considerations
- Comparison with other access control models

- Permission inheritance principles
- System vs. custom roles
- Role scope and boundaries
- Cross-workspace considerations
- Integration with identity providers
- Diagram of RBAC architecture

## Roles Management

### System Roles
- Administrator role capabilities
