# User Management

The User Management module is the foundation of access control within Rezolve.ai, providing comprehensive tools for managing user accounts and their permissions:

## User Registration and Onboarding

- **Batch Import**: Register multiple users simultaneously via CSV upload
- **Azure AD Integration**: Synchronize users directly from Microsoft Azure Active Directory
- **Manual Creation**: Add individual users with custom profile information
- **Invitation Workflow**: Send email invitations with self-registration links
- **Status Management**: Control active, inactive, and pending account states

## Role Management

Roles in Rezolve.ai define what actions users can perform and what areas of the platform they can access:

- **Predefined Roles**: Assign standard roles such as Tenant Admin, User Admin, Ticket Agent, Knowledge Manager, Bot Analyst, and more
- **Custom Roles**: Create organization-specific roles with tailored permission sets
- **Multi-Role Support**: Assign multiple roles to individual users when needed
- **Role Hierarchy**: Establish permission inheritance relationships between roles

### Module-Based Permissions

Control access to specific platform modules:

- Ticket Management
- Live Chat
- Virtual Agent Management
- Learning Management
- Analytics
- Knowledge Management
