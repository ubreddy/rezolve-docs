# Role-Based Access Control

## Data Access Control

Data is categorized broadly into two categories:
1. Data that is prepared for serving the employees.
    - Example: Knowledge Base articles, Ticket templates, Bot Flows, etc.
2. Data that is generated by employees.
    - Example: Tickets, Chat transcripts, etc.

### Data For Employee Usage
These are normally prepared by helpdesk teams or subteams based on department, location and other dimensions as needed by the organization.

For granular control of preparing and authoring this data [Teams](../teams-management/teams-management-overview) and [Workspaces](../workspace-management/workspace-management-overview) are used.

### Accessing Employee Data

While the employees have access to all the data prepared by helpdesk teams or subteams, they can only access the data that is relevant to them based on their roles, locations, attributes etc.

For this purpose [Audience](../audience-management/audience-management-overview) is used.

### Generated Data

Employees generate data when they use the platform. This data is also protected by row level security.
 Only users who have access on the record for view/edit will be able to view/edit the data. This is implemented based on combination of Roles and Actors.

#### Actors

These are user directly indirectly assigned to the record. e.g. Requested by, Assigned to etc. Based on the actors the user has access to the record.
