# Roles and Permissions

All roles and permissions are available in the [Roles](./roles) page.

However, granular roles can be created for any individual user that you'd like to give extra privileges to. For this, got to Admin App > User Management > View User

Click on manage roles and select the roles group > roles/permissions that you'd want to add specifically for this user.
