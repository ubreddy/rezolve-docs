# Roles and Permissions

This guide provides a detailed explanation of the platform's roles and permissions structure, helping administrators understand how to configure appropriate access levels for users.

## Understanding Roles

### Role Types
- System roles (predefined)
- Custom roles (administrator-created)
- Workspace-specific roles
- Team-specific roles
- Integration roles
- Service account roles
- Screenshot of role types

### Role Hierarchy
- Super administrator privileges
- Administrator tier permissions
- Manager level capabilities
- Standard user permissions
- Guest access limitations
- Role inheritance principles
- Diagram of role hierarchy

### Role Components
