# March 2025 Release

We're excited to announce our March 2025 release with several new features and improvements!

## Release Date: 7th March 

### 1: Creator Studio :Script Validator for Adaptive Cards

#### Overview
This release introduces a script validation feature within Creator Studio to enhance the development experience when working with Adaptive Cards.

#### New Capabilities

* Script Validation: Creator Studio now includes a built-in code validator for Adaptive Card JSON scripts.

* Error Highlighting: The validator highlights the specific line(s) where an error occurs in the Adaptive Card JSON content.

#### Problem Addressed

Previously, there was no validation for Adaptive Card JSON within Creator Studio. As a result, incorrect or malformed JSON could cause the bot flow to break without giving visibility into the issue, making it difficult for implementation engineers to debug. This feature solves that problem by providing immediate feedback and pinpointing issues within the Adaptive Card structure.

### 2: Dashboard - Support for "IS EMPTY" and related operators in filters

#### Overview

The Actor (Assigned To) field in dashboard filters now supports "IS EMPTY" and other logical operators to help users create more precise and insightful chart filters.

#### New Capabilities

* Added Operator: `IS EMPTY`
  * Enables filtering data where the Actor/Assigned To field is blank or unassigned.

* Additional Operators Supported:
  * `IS`
  * `NOT IN`
  * `IS ONE OF`

* Improved Filter Flexibility:
  * Allows users to include/exclude tickets where no actor is assigned, aiding better analysis of unassigned workloads.

#### Use Case

In dashboards like "My Workload Dashboard", users can now include a filter condition to identify incidents with no assignee (`Actor IS EMPTY`). This helps teams monitor backlog or unattended tickets more effectively.

#### Impact

* Enhances reporting accuracy for operational dashboards.
* Supports quicker detection of bottlenecks and assignment gaps.
* Streamlines chart customization for advanced analytics.

## Release Date: 13th March 2025

### 1: Dashboard and Reports â€“ Ticket Data Accuracy Fix

#### Overview

We have resolved an issue where dashboards and reports sometimes displayed incorrect ticket data due to inconsistencies in data aggregation logic. This update ensures that all analytics and exports now accurately reflect the actual ticket records across the system.

#### Problem Addressed

Previously, users noticed discrepancies between ticket data shown in dashboards/reports and the underlying records. This resulted in potential misreporting of ticket volumes, statuses, and other key metrics, impacting operational and management decisions.

The issue occurred due to a redesign of chart-level access based on the product template, and now we have implemented the new design to ensure seamless functionality.

#### Fix Details

* Chart-level access is being redesigned based on the product template for improved security and flexibility.
* Due to this redesign, an issue occurred that caused dashboards and reports to display incorrect ticket data.
* The data aggregation logic has now been corrected to ensure alignment between displayed metrics and the actual ticket database.
* Export and subscription processes have also been updated to use accurate data.

#### Impact

* Dashboards now show ticket counts, statuses, and metrics that match the true state of the ticketing system
* Exported reports (CSV/PDF) and scheduled subscriptions reflect correct ticket data
* Improved confidence in analytics for all users

#### User Guidance

No user action is required. All dashboards and reports now display accurate information automatically. If you previously exported reports with discrepancies, we recommend re-generating them for the most up-to-date data.



### 2: Chart Level Filter Creation Issue

#### Overview

We have addressed an issue that was preventing users from creating chart-level filters within dashboards and reports. This fix restores full filter creation functionality, enabling users to customize their charts as needed for more targeted analysis.
