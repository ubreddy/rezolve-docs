# June 2025 Release

We're excited to announce our June 2025 release with several new features and improvements!

## Release Date: 3rd June

### 1: Dashboard -  Admin should be able to optionally add a tooltip to describe the chart

#### Overview
This feature enhances the dashboard charts by allowing administrators to add optional tooltip text that provides additional context or explanation for charts. When enabled, a tooltip icon appears on the chart, displaying the explanatory text when users hover over it.

#### New Capabilities
- Administrators can now add optional tooltip text when creating or editing charts
- If tooltip text is provided, a tooltip icon will appear on the chart, displaying the text on hover
- If tooltip text is left blank, no tooltip icon will appear, ensuring a clean UI without unnecessary indicators
- Tooltips help users better understand chart data and context without cluttering the interface

#### Problem Addressed
Users previously lacked contextual information about charts in the dashboard, making it difficult to understand the purpose, data sources, or interpretation of certain visualizations. This feature addresses the need for providing additional explanatory information without cluttering the chart interface.

### 2: Data was missing in knowledge Gaps

#### Overview
An issue was identified where Knowledge Gap data was not appearing as expected in the platform. This impacted reporting and visibility into knowledge article performance and gaps.

#### Root Cause Analysis
The issue stemmed from missing or unprocessed data in the backend pipeline responsible for aggregating and displaying knowledge gap insights. The system failed to surface the required data, resulting in blank or incomplete views.

#### Problem Addressed
This release fixes the data processing pipeline to ensure complete and accurate Knowledge Gap data is properly collected, processed, and displayed. The fix restores full visibility into knowledge article performance metrics and gap analysis capabilities.
